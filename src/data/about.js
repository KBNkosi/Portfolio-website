      "My journey into tech began with a childhood curiosity about how computers work. While I enjoyed playing games, I was more fascinated in how the computer worked under the hood and its mechanics.",
      "That early curiosity matured while I was studying for a diploma in Logistics. I naturally became the go-to person in my family for anything tech-related, from troubleshooting devices to solving software issues. I'd spend hours researching, experimenting, and learning.",
      "This passion led me to transition from Logistics to Information Technology, where I discovered web development. What drew me to web development is the power to bring ideas to life, especially in this digital-first world where businesses, ideas, and people all need a space to be seen, heard, and experienced.",
      "Today, I'm focused on continuously learning and growing into a well-rounded developer who can make a real impact. I'm particularly passionate about creating digital solutions that help businesses and individuals establish their online presence effectively."
